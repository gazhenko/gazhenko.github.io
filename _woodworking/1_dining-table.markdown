This is a bit of a throwback to 2016 when I just got into woodworking and didn't really know what I was doing (frankly I still don't). We had just moved into our first house from an apartment and we had a room for "dining" but no dining table. My wife was hesitant about taking on a large project like this but eventually I talked her into it (_big mistake_) and we went to home depot to buy some wood. Decided to go cheap and simple and we bought about $100 worth of pine lumber. Took about 2 weeks overall (about an hour a day every couple days) but it really fueled my passion for woodworking and overall was a really fun build.

I basically followed this plan from Ann White: <a href="https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/rekourt-dining-table-1">rekourt-dining-table</a>. I've gotten a bunch of ideas from that site, so please check it out and show them some &hearts;.

	Decided to go with a dark walnut stain. Feel like it compliments the lighter colored rest of the room and sort of stands out.

	All the lumber was run through the table saw to get those super squared off sides, makes it look less like lumber and more like something that belongs on a piece of furniture. I didn't have a fence at the time, so I ended up with a few defects here and there.
